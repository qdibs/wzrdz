            <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-4">i. The user that is buying and minting our WZRDZ artwork is the owner of the Non Fungible Token (NFT) crated by validating the transaction. Each WZRDZ is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own all the rights to the underlying WZRDZ. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely and only by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network which means that, at no point, may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any WZRDZ. ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, wzrdz-nft.com grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased WZRDZ, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your WZRDZ/NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each WZRDZ owner’s rights to display the WZRDZ and ensures that only the actual owner can display the WZRDZ; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your WZRDZ, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each WZRDZ owner’s rights to display the WZRDZ and ensures that only the actual owner can display the WZRDZ, and provided that the WZRDZ is no longer visible once the owner of the WZRDZ leaves the website/application. iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, wzrdz-nft.com grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased WZRDZ for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the WZRDZ (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would be the use of the WZRDZ to produce products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the WZRDZ. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of WZRDZ generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each WZRDZ owner’s rights to display the WZRDZ and ensures that only the actual owner can display the WZRDZ; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of WZRDZ generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each WZRDZ owner’s rights to display the WZRDZ and ensures that only the actual owner can display the WZRDZ, and provided that the WZRDZ is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased WZRDZ leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
